Archiving provides a cost-effective solution for long-term storage of logs that don't need to be instantly searchable. You can configure Logz.io to archive logs to an AWS S3 bucket or a Microsoft Azure Storage account.

When you need to investigate old logs after they have expired from your account, you can restore them to a temporary account with no additional storage costs.

Restored accounts are complimentary, and do not count against your daily log volume.

### Known limitations

Each account (or sub-account) should archive to a separate S3 bucket.

The maximum amount of data that can be restored is equal to your accountâ€™s daily reserved volume and is capped at 100 GB for all accounts (including accounts with a daily reserved volume greater than 100 GB).

If the restore process exceeds this maximum, the process fails.

* The max data to restore is equivalent to your account's daily **reserved volume**, and no more than 100 GB.
