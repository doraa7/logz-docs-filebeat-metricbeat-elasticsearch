To create a new optimizer, start in OpenSearch Dashboards so you can test the query you want to use.

Before creating an optimizer, you'll need a timeless account to send the data to. If you need help setting up a timeless account, see [Manage timeless accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/user-guide/accounts/manage-the-main-account-and-sub-accounts.html#timeless).

After you've created your account, navigate back to **OpenSearch Dashboards** > **Create an optimizer**, where you can configure the optimizer settings.

Once a log is pulled to your Logz.io account, it takes up to **2 hours** until it appears in your timeless account.

If you want help updating an existing optimizer, you can [skip the first part of this page](#to-configure-an-optimizer).

#### To create an optimizer

##### Set your query in OpenSearch Dashboards

In OpenSearch Dashboards, type a query in the query bar
and press **Enter**.

Review the results in the histogram and the document table,
and make sure your query returned the expected results.

Click **Create Optimizer** (above the query bar) to open the **Create an optimizer** page. <br>
Continue with [To configure an optimizer](#to-configure-an-optimizer).

<div class="tasklist">

##### Name the optimizer

Type a **Name** and a detailed **Description**.

##### _(Optional)_ Edit the search settings

If you need to, change your optimizer **Query** and the **Accounts** that the query searches.

<!-- info-box-start:info -->
If you use an invalid query, the optimizer will automatically be disabled.
Run your query in OpenSearch Dashboards so you can be sure you're getting the expected results. <br><br>
The filter tags that are displayed in the Optimizer **Query** section indicate which filters you used for the query in **Discover**. 
To update the filters, you'll need to add them to your search in **Discover**.

##### _(Optional)_ Edit group by settings

To store aggregate results, group your search fields.

Click **Group by** to add up to 3 groups.

In the **Choose fields** list,
choose a field to group by.

To limit the available fields,
choose a log type from the **Filter by type** list.
To show fields for all log types,
choose **Clear filter**.

##### Set the frequency

In the **Trigger** section, choose how often this optimizer should run.

##### Choose a timeless account

In the **Action** section, choose a timeless account to send to.

##### Choose an output format

Choose an **Output**.


To send the raw JSON documents to your timeless account, choose **Full log**.


To send a summary table, choose **Aggregations**.

  If you added any groups (in step 3), the aggregations table will show the aggregated fields that you used. To change these fields, you'll need to change your Group by selection.
