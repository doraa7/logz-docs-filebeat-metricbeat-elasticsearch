Use Event Management to monitor the events triggered by your alerts.

Event Management offers a single source of truth into triggered alerts in your environment. It allows you to track alerts, set their status, add comments and additional information, and prioritize how those issues are handled.

The events are displayed in a table: You can sort the events table by severity, status, handler (who theyâ€™re assigned to), last triggering data, and the last time the event was updated or edited. You can also filter and search the events in the table to further refine your results.

## The Event Management table


![Event management](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/alerts/event-management-main.png)

The information that is provided for each event triggered is summarized in the table. The retention for the Event Management table is two weeks, and the number of events you can view is bound by the number of triggered alerts.
