* The last six characters of your [account token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-accounts)

The Support team will respond with the connection information needed to set up your Google Workspace SSO.

Log into your [Google Workspace panel](https://admin.google.com/AdminHome).

In the sidebar, navigate to Apps > Web and mobile apps. Click on **Add app** and choose the **Add custom SAML** app option.

#### Google Workspace SSO groups


When [creating access groups for Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9050643?hl=en), you need to add a custom attribute to connect it to your Logz.io SAML application.

First, **[add a custom attribute](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6208725?hl=en)** and link it to your SAML app.

Open your SAML app, navigate to the **Add a new custom attribute** section, and add the following configuration:

* Name: groups
* Info type: Text
* Visibility: Visible to user and admin
* Number of values: Multi-value
