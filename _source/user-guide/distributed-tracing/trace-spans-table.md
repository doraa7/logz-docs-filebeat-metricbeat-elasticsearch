The Spans Table provides a table view of your services and operations. It’s a textual representation of what’s happening inside your trace, and you can filter your view based on a specific service or operation.

Use this view to identify high latencies in services.

The table includes the following columns:

* Service name
* Operation in which it executed
* The Trace's ID
* The service's running duration
* Each service's start time and date

In addition, you can filter your view by clicking on the Duration or Start Time columns.
