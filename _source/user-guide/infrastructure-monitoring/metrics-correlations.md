Your Metrics account offers several ways to correlate data between your Logz.io Infrastructure Monitoring and Log Management accounts:

1. Annotations can mark events on your Metrics dashboards based on data from a logging account. [Learn more about Annotations](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/annotations/).

2. Drill down links offer a quick way to get from an Infrastructure Monitoring metrics visualization to the relevant logs in Log Management. [Learn more about **Explore in OpenSearch Dashboards** links](/user-guide/infrastructure-monitoring/explore-in-logs-drilldown-links).
<!--Future proof: How will we handle replacing "Kibana" all over the product and documentation? -->
