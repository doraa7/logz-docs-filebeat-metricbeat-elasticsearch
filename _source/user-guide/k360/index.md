#### Getting started with Kubernetes 360

To activate your Kubernetes 360 dashboard, connect your Kubernetes data quickly and easily through Logz.io's **[Telemetry Collector](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new)**.


##### Manually shipping Kubernetes data
{:.no_toc}

If you've already connected your Kubernetes data or prefer to send it [manually](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/collection?tag=all&collection=prometheus-sources), you'll need an active **[Infrastructure Monitoring](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/metrics)** account, and ensure that your Kubernetes data is [connected to Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/send-your-data/agent/new).

In addition, you'll need to ship your cluster metrics from the following sources:

* Node exporter (should be installed on every node).
* CAdvisor.
* Kube-state-metrics version 2.1 or higher.

And send the following metrics:

|**Metric name**||**Labels**|
|*||p8s_logzio_name `// Equivalent to a Cluster's name`|
|kube_pod_status_phase||pod, uid, node, host_ip, phase, namespace|
|kube_pod_info||pod,namespace,p8s_logzio_name,region|
|container_cpu_usage_seconds_total||pod, region, topology_kubernetes_io_region, container|

##### Manually configuring Security Risks

To add Security risks view to your existing Kubernetes data, you need to:

* [Install Logz.io's Trivy operator]()
* Configure and send security logs

After deploying the updated Helm chart, ensure you're sending the following logs:

|**Source**|**Log**|
|kubernetes|host_ip|
|kubernetes|container_name|
|kubernetes|pod_uid|
|kubernetes|deployment_name|
|kubernetes|pod_ip|
|kubernetes|node_name|
|kubernetes|resource_kind|
|kubernetes|resource_name|
|kubernetes|namespace_name|
|kubernetes|pod_name|
||severity|
||resource|
||title|
||env_id|
||vulnerabilityID|
||primaryLink|


If you encounter an issue while setting up your metrics or logs, [contact Logz.io's support team](mailto:help@logz.io) for additional help.

Once everything is up and running, you can use your Kubernetes 360 application. [See what it has to offer](/user-guide/k360/kubernetes-360.html).

<!-- #### Kubernetes 360 overview

Kubernetes 360 application provides a quick overview of your current deployments and nodes.

You can switch your view to focus on **Deployments** or **Nodes** using the buttons at the top right.

The **deployments view** includes cards representing the different deployments, a quick overview of the deployment's average CPU and memory, and a rundown of the pods' status. You can quickly identify whether pods are failing, if they're consuming a high amount of CPU, memory, if they had multiple restarts, and the number of log error rates inside. The pods' colors indicate their current status, when red dots indicate an issue with this pod.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/focus-on-deployment.png)


The **node view** includes a summary of each node's physical CPU, memory, and disk. It also has a rundown of the inner pods’ status similar to the deployments view, including how many pods are failing, whether they’re using a high CPU or memory, the number of restarts, and the log error rate.

![deployments card](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/focus-on-nodes.png)


Click on the cards or the elements inside them to get more information through the **[Quick view](/user-guide/k360/overview.html#quick-view)** menu.

<!-- #### Investigate through quick view 

##### See Metrics
{:.no_toc}

Whether you’re viewing a deployment, node, or pod, you can easily investigate the different issues you might encounter. 

Each quick view menu contains the **View Metrics** button, allowing you to view the relevant information in a Grafana application. This can provide a focused overview of the chosen element, allowing you to pinpoint what happened and when it started quickly.

##### See Logs
{:.no_toc}

Node and pod views include the **See Logs** button, which opens an OpenSearch Dashboard screen with the relevant query to display the log information.

If you've set up your Kubernetes account manually, you might get an empty query with no results. In this case, you can use a custom filter to view all related logs.

Click on **Add filter** at the top of the screen. The fields vary according to your chosen view; add `kubernetes.host` to the field to view Node related logs. To view Pod related logs, add `kubernetes.pod_name` to the field.

Next, choose the operator. For example, you can select **exists** to view all of the related logs.

##### Locate
{:.no_toc}

To re-focus your view, click on the **Locate** button at the top of the quick view menu. This will scroll back to the specific deployment, node, or pod you're investigating.

![Locate button](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/locate-button.gif)

##### Logs tab
{:.no_toc}

Nodes and pods quick view menu has an additional **Logs** tab that contains a table with all of the logs related to the chosen node or pod. The table includes the total number of logs, the time they were ingested, the log level, and its message.

![Logs inside nodes](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/k360/logs-inside-nodes.png)

You can sort the table by clicking on each header: **Time**, **Log level**, or **Message**. Click on the same header again to change your view to ascending/descending.

#### Additional information

###### Calculating Log error rate

To calculate percentage error, we take the percentage of errors in the last 15 minutes and the percentage of errors in the last 2 hours:

`Errors in the last 15 minutes <= Amount of errors in the last 2 hours`

For example, if in the last 15 minutes there were 10 log errors out of 200 total logs, it means that there's a total of 5% errors:

`10/200 * 100 = 5%`

And if in the last 2 hours there were 15 log errors out of 800 total logs, the percentage of errors will be 1.8%:

`15/800 * 100 = 1.8%`

So the log error rate you'll see will be 177.7%, based on the following formula:

`(5/1.8 * 100) - 100 = 177.7%`

Additional examples: 

* Last 15 minutes = 5 error logs out of 50 total logs = 5/50 * 100 = 10%
* Last 2 hours = 6 error logs out of 800 total logs = 6/800 * 100 = 0.75%
* Error rate = (10/0.75 * 100) - 100 = 1233.3%

Or:

* Last 15 minutes = 2 error logs out of 100 total logs = 2/100 * 100 = 2%
* Last 2 hours = 2 error logs out of 800 total logs = 2/800 * 100 = 0.25%
* Error rate = (2/0.25 * 100) - 100 = 700%
