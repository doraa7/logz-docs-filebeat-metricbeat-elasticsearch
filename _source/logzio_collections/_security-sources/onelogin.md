OneLogin is a cloud-based identity and access management (IAM) provider. This integration allows you to ship logs from your OneLogin account to your Logz.io account.

**Before you begin, you'll need**: 

* An active account with OneLogin
* An actie account with Logz.io

* In the **Title** field, enter **logzio**.

* In the **Format** field, select **SIEM (NDJSON)**.

* In the **Listener URL** field, enter `https://<<LISTENER-HOST>>:8071/?token=<<LOG-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>&type=onelogin`. {% include log-shipping/listener-var.html %} {% include log-shipping/log-shipping-token.md %}


##### Save changes

When everything is filled out, click **Save**.


##### Check Logz.io for your logs

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours, and then open [Open Search Dashboards](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/osd). You can search for `type:onelogin` to filter for your OneLogin logs.
  
If you still donâ€™t see your logs, see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
